Firefox offers several ways to get help and report issues.
Organizations can contact enterprise support for technical assistance or explore the support.mozilla.org (SUMO) knowledge base for common solutions.

## Support for Organizations

Mozilla provides professional support options for organizations that rely on Firefox.
Support for Organizations is a dedicated offering for teams who need private issue triage and escalation, defined response times, custom development options, and close collaboration with Mozilla's engineering and product teams.
