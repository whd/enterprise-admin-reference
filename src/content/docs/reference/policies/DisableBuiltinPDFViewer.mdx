Disable the built in PDF viewer. PDF files are downloaded and sent externally.

> [!NOTE] As of Firefox 140, this policy no longer completely disables PDF.js; it changes the handler to send PDF files to the operating system.
> Embedded PDF files are shown in the browser.
> If you need to completely disable PDF.js, you can use the [`PDFjs`](/reference/policies/pdfjs) policy.
