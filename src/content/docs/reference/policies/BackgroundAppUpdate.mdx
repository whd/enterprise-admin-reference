description: "Enable or disable automatic application update in the background, when the application is not running."
---

Enable or disable automatic application update **in the background**, when the application is not running.

If set to `true`, application updates may be installed (without explicit user approval) in the background, even when the application is not running.
The operating system may still require approval.

If set to `false`, the application will not try to install updates when the application is not running.

If you are having trouble getting the background task to run, verify your configuration with the ["Requirements to run" section in this support document](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/enable-background-updates-firefox-windows).

> [!NOTE]
> The `BackgroundAppUpdate` policy has no effect if you have disabled updates via the [`DisableAppUpdate`](/reference/policies/disableappupdate) policy or disabled automatic updates via the [`AppAutoUpdate`](/reference/policies/appautoupdate) policy.

**Compatibility:** Firefox 90 (Windows only)\
**CCK2 Equivalent:** N/A\
