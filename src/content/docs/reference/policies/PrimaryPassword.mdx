Require or prevent using a primary (formerly master) password.

If this value is true, a primary password is required.
If this value is false, it works the same as if [`DisableMasterPasswordCreation`](/reference/policies/disablemasterpasswordcreation) was true and removes the primary password functionality.

If both `DisableMasterPasswordCreation` and `PrimaryPassword` are used, `DisableMasterPasswordCreation` takes precedence.
