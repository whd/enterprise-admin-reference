Install certificates into the Firefox certificate store.
If only a filename is specified, Firefox searches for the file in the following locations:

- Windows
  - `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Mozilla\Certificates`
  - `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Certificates`
- macOS
  - `/Library/Application Support/Mozilla/Certificates`
  - `~/Library/Application Support/Mozilla/Certificates`
- Linux
  - `/usr/lib/mozilla/certificates`
  - `/usr/lib64/mozilla/certificates`
  - `~/.mozilla/certificates`

Starting with Firefox 65, Firefox 60.5 ESR, a fully qualified path can be used, including UNC paths.
You should use the native path style for your operating system.
We do not support using `%USERPROFILE%` or other environment variables on Windows.

If you are specifying the path in the policies.json file on Windows, you need to escape your backslashes (`\\`) which means that for UNC paths, you need to escape both (`\\\\`).
If you use group policy, you only need one backslash.

Certificates are installed using the trust string `CT,CT,`.

Binary (DER) and ASCII (PEM) certificates are both supported.

**Compatibility:** Firefox 64, Firefox ESR 64\
