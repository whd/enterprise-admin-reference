## Configuring Firefox as an enterprise browser

Organizations have fine-grained administrative and orchestration control of the browser's behavior by using enterprise policies in [Firefox and Firefox Extended Support Release (ESR)](/guides/firefox-channels/).
Firefox can be deployed and managed with common enterprise configuration systems such as Microsoft Intune, JAMF, MDM, and other software-distribution platforms.
