Firefox is made available in multiple versions known as **release channels**.
This article describes the difference between the channels and the tradeoffs to consider when choosing one.
The two channels that are most appropriate for enterprise usage are **Firefox** and **Firefox Extended Support Release (ESR)**.

## Firefox Release channel

The **Firefox** release channel is primarily used by consumers, but it is also applicable as an enterprise browser.
A new major ([semver](https://semver.org/)) version is made available every four weeks.
Releases include new features, enhancements, and bug fixes.

The following resources are useful for tracking what's changed in Firefox releases:

- [Firefox releases](https://www.firefox.com/en-US/releases/): details on the features and fixes improve everyday browsing.
- [Firefox release notes for developers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox/Releases): these release notes describe **developer-facing** changes.
  This contains details on new or updated web platform features, APIs, and tools that developers use.

> [!NOTE]
> This release channel is best suited for organizations that want the latest and features as soon as they are available.
> Because this release channel contains more frequent updates than ESR, UI changes, privacy or security changes may require testing with your environment in a more frequent cadence than the Extended Support Release.

## Firefox Extended Support Release (ESR)

New versions of ESR are released **annually**.
After release, each ESR version receives incremental security updates as _minor_ or _patch_ release versions (`major.minor.patch`).
Other features, such as UI or UX improvements, are excluded from the ESR channel, and are limited to annual ESR releases.

> [!NOTE]
> ESR is ideal for deployment environments that need stability and long-term compatibility.
> It may be convenient to choose ESR to avoid frequent QA cycles, for example.
> Other enterprise systems may rely on visual or behavioral consistency during testing or in production environments.
