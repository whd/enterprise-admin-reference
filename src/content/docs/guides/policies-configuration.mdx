title: Configuring policies
description: A reference page in Firefox Enterprise support docs.

Firefox enterprise policies can be applied using Group Policy for Active Directory-joined devices, Intune for cloud-based device management, or by creating a file called `policies.json` and setting the contents of the JSON file.

import { Code } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import policy from "/src/examples/policy.json?raw";

## Configuring Firefox using `policies.json`

Using a `policies.json` file is a cross-platform method for configuring the Firefox browser.
Firefox checks for the existence of a `policies.json` file and applies configuration based on its contents.
For each operating system, there is a defined location that Firefox will check:

- **On Windows**, create a directory called `distribution` where the Firefox executable is located and place the `policies.json` file there.
- **On macOS**, the `policies.json` file goes into `Firefox.app/Contents/Resources/distribution`.
- **On Linux**, the `policies.json` file goes into `firefox/distribution`, where `firefox` is the installation directory for firefox, which varies by distribution.
  Alternatively, you may specify system-wide policy by placing the file in `/etc/firefox/policies`.

> [!NOTE]
> The `policies.json` files must be `UTF-8`-encoded.

An example policy looks as follows:

<Code code={policy} lang="json" title="policies.json" />

### Policy annotations

JSON does not support comments, but it is possible to add extra members to JSON which can serve as comments or annotations.
For example, `Authentication_Comment` is an internal value used for documentation in the following policy:

```json
{
  "policies": {
    "Authentication": {
      "SPNEGO": ["mydomain.com", "https://myotherdomain.com"]
    }
    "Authentication_Comment": "These domains are required for us"
  }
}
```

> [!WARNING]
> If you add comments in this way, `about:policies` will display an error due to expected syntax, but the policies will be applied as expected.
